\section{Procedural Generation}

Very broadly speaking, in game development there are two primary ways to generate content for a project. The most common and controllable way is to make each part by hand - in our 			case we'll be referring to a 2D tile map as our content.
		
For small maps this isn't a problem; it's very straight-forward to declare each tile as an element of a statically-sized 2D array (we'll go into how this is done later) and just draw those tiles 	to the screen, perhaps also drawing different sprites on top of each tile for NPC's or the player. But what happens as our map grows in size? As it goes from a 32 x 32 map to a 256 x 256 sized map, or even larger? Even if we've created a system for writing our maps out as text files to be read in, already saving lots of time, this can very quickly become time-consuming. This is a valid way of generating content, in fact the developers on CD Projekt Red's The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt did just that \parencite[1]{witcher}, a pretty amazing feat. However, we don't have the resources or manpower of CD Projekt Red, so what's the solution?
		
\paragraph{Procedural Generation algorithms are the solution}\mbox{}
		
Games such as Minecraft, Dwarf Fortress, and the upcoming No Mans Sky all make use of procedural generation to generate enormous, beautiful, but seemingly random worlds. We say \emph{seemingly} random because, aside from computers only being able to generate \emph{pseudo}-random numbers, these algorithms are designed so that, with the same starting point, it will produce the same result.
		
\paragraph{"So then where do we start?"}
		
Good question. Many games, such as in indie title Dwarf Corp. \parencite{dwarfcorp}, begin by simulating tectonic plate activity which is how terrain forms in the real world), but we're going to go a different route and start by generating a realistic height map, a 2D array of elements that hold a generated elevation value, that we'll use to base the rest of our map off. We will use this starting point to procedurally generate a map that can be navigated by the player. Along the way, we will make heavy use of the SwinGame API to handle all graphics-related functionality and briefly touch on other concepts such as basic collision detection, all of which we will code using Pascal.
	
	
\section{Diamonds \& Squares}\label{diamonds-squares}


To generate a heightmap, it would be possible to design an algorithm from scratch, however that would take a long time and the result probably wouldn't be very effective, so we're going to borrow a very well-known and academically sound one called \textbf{Random Midpoint Displacement} \parencite[2]{fournier}, also known as \textbf{the Diamond-Square Algorithm}. At its core, the purpose of this algorithm is to generate pseudo-random noise in a desirable pattern, i.e.~one that resembles a realistic spread of terrain height values. Each point of noise is stored in a data structure (in our case, a 2D array) and holds a single value - a number representing its elevation. The result is something like this:

\end{figure}

\paragraph{The basic concept behind Diamond-Square can be summed up like so:}
	
\begin{itemize}
	\item
		Take an empty grid which must be of size \(2^{n}+1\) in order to work. Then assign the corners a \emph{seed} value, a number that all other calculations are based off. This means 				that with the same seed, we should get the exact same result.
	\item
		\textbf{The Sqaure Step} - Take the grids four corners, average their total, find their mid point and assign that point the average plus a random value.
	\item
		\textbf{The Diamond Step} - Given the previous step, we now have a diamond shape surrounding a new mid point. Take the average of all points in the diamond and assign the new 			midpoint that value plus a random amount.
	\item
		Use a \mintinline{Pascal}{nextStep} variable to determine the next point to calculate. 
	\item
		Iterate until \mintinline{Pascal}{nextStep} is smaller than zero
\end{itemize}
	
This process can be best visualized using graphs, seen in the example pictured below.

\paragraph{Using this algorithm, we now have the ability to generate a starting point.}
However, before starting on an implementation, as with all software development, it's a good idea to define the requirements for our program - what functions, procedures, data structures, and features do we want to include?
	
\begin{itemize}
\item
	First, we will define the data structures that will be required by our program. We're going to first need a \mintinline{pascal}{Tile record} to hold data related to each tile in the map such as if it's 		collidable, the bitmap that should be drawn for it, it's type, and elevation. We'll also need a \mintinline{pascal}{MapData record} to contain our tile grid, the players sprite and location data, and 	its size.
\item
	Very importantly, we'll also need our terrain generation procedures - \mintinline{pascal}{DiamondSquare()} \& \mintinline{pascal}{GenerateTerrain()}. \mintinline{pascal}{DiamondSquare()} will be 	responsible for creating a new heightmap for a passed-in \mintinline{pascal}{MapData()} record, whereas \mintinline{pascal}{GenerateTerrain()} will be responsible for deciding how each tile 		should be rendered based off the heightmap, alongside generating trees on the passed-in \mintinline{pascal}{MapData()} record.
\item
	Now that our terrain generation functions and structures are defined, we'll also need a \mintinline{pascal}{CreateMap()} function to call both of the above procedures and then to search for an 	appropriate place on the map to spawn the player.
\item
	Finally, we'll need both a \mintinline{pascal}{HandleInput()} procedure and a \mintinline{pascal}{DrawMap()} procedure to move the player around while detecting collision tiles and to draw the 	tile grid to the screen respectively.
\end{itemize}

There will also be several functions and resources referenced later on that we won't be building as they aren't directly related to procedural generation and are just utilities for allowing our map to render properly. These can be downloaded from
